Notebooks and datasets for Session 2.

### The key statistical concepts that will be explored this session are:

- What is correlation and how to measure the strengh of correlation?
- Application of correlation in real world. For example, how correlation is often used in portfolio management to measure the amount of diversification among the assets contained in a portfolio.

- Explore different variable types in analytics or statistics in the following notebook.
- How to visualize the distribution of different types of variables.

#### 1.1 Corelation Analysis (Exercise Solution)

Download the daily stock price of four or five randomly selected stocks from very different sectors or industries for the last 6 months. (Each of these stocks should have been taken from different industry sectors.)

- Find out the outlier events (date and the gain or loss) for each of these stocks based on box plot analysis.
- Find out the correlation of daily gains of each of these stocks.
- Draw the scatter plots and the heatmap.
